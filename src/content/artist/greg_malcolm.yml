    snippet: "We don’t do idiosyncratic well in New Zealand. Christchurch guitarist
      Greg Malcolm is the embodiment of the word, and sadly it’s worked against
      him here. Globally, Malcolm is one of an elite tribe of musicians
      embodying an ethos promoted through The Wire magazine: one of freefalling,
      no-jazz improvisation."
