title: Koizilla
description: An absolute pillar of the scene, Koizilla has shared a stage with pretty much every local band since their <a href="/gigs/the-last-gig-at-the-dungeon/">first gig</a> in 2016 to their <a href="/gigs/koizilla---the-final-jam/">last gig</a> in 2025. Along the way they released six albums and a split, spawned numerous spinoff bands, and supported many upcoming musicians through their tireless work. RIP and massive aroha to the GOATs (...but they will live on in other projects).
