2024 officially marks 10 years of dunedinsound.com. It also crossed a couple of other milestones: The 100th crown hotel gig (which was Dankfest), and [The Rothmans](/artists/the_rothmans) were finally toppled by bitter rival [Koizilla](/artists/koizilla) as the most attended artist with 35 gigs. If they want their crown back they’ll have to leave Bristol.

## Data

<Image size="blog" responsiveImage={frontmatter.responsiveImages['velocity-over-time']} alt="Gig velocity over time (a graph showing number of gigs attended slumping during 2021 and 2022, then rising)"/>

**Analysis:** Gig velocity appears to be recovering after a COVID slump.  
**Forecast:** The upwards trend will likely decrease and velocity will stabilize around the 50 mark or slightly under. It is unlikely to return to peak levels due to the unfortunate fact that I’m not 20 anymore.

## Gig Highlights

As usual this is not an exhaustive list of every gig I enjoyed, this is just ones which stand out to me for whatever reason when looking back. I went to loads of amazing gigs which aren't mentioned here.

In chronological order.

### [Kilat Aotearoa Tour MMXXIV](/gigs/kilat-aotearoa-tour-mmxxiv/)

<Image size="blog" responsiveImage={frontmatter.responsiveImages['kilat']} alt="Kilat Aotearoa Tour MMXXIV"/>

This year we got a surprising number of smaller touring artists, one of which was Kilat, a black metal three piece from Naarm (also known as Melbourne). Alongside local extreme music stalwarts CUCK, Mandate, and Distant Fear from Auckland, they put on a raw, intense, punishing performance. Of all the subgenres black metal is sadly under-represented in the local scene (it’s mostly death/doom/stoner), so it was great to see something at least black metal influenced (and thankfully not remotely atmospheric). And all for $30 on the door. Underground music on top.

### [Hyperculte NZ Tour](/gigs/hyperculte-nz-tour/)

<Image size="blog" responsiveImage={frontmatter.responsiveImages['hyperculte']} alt="Hyperculte NZ Tour"/>

Hyperculte came all the way from Switzerland and played YOURS. I don’t think anyone knew what to expect going in (even after listening to recorded material you never really know) and everyone I talked to after was blown away. A singing multi-instrumentalist drummer, extremely tight live production (they brought their own sound person), and hypnotic danceable rhythms. It reminded me somewhat of The Knife. Very grateful to them for playing our small town.

### [Feastock 2024](/gigs/feastock-2024/)

<Image size="blog" responsiveImage={frontmatter.responsiveImages['feastock']} alt="Feastock 2024"/>

Embarrassingly this was the first Feastock I’ve been to since 2017 and my second Feastock ever... It’s just a hell of a lot of effort, in general I’d prefer to see 50 small gigs over 1 big gig. I’m weird though, most people love festivals. And actually this year so did I. The weather was perfect, the lineup diverse and eclectic enough to offer something for everyone, and I left feeling immensely grateful for the people who put in a lot of work for a relatively small crowd and likely little to no financial profit. Events like this are so so valuable. Highlights included Blood Cauldron’s lead singer “Beleth Cephalor” roaming the grounds for potential new acolytes. And Pretty Dumb scaring the gen X’ers with Nirvana dubstep remixes.

### [Kowhitikaru After Party](/gigs/kowhitikaru-after-party/)

<Image size="blog" responsiveImage={frontmatter.responsiveImages['kowhitikaru']} alt="Kowhitikaru After Party"/>

This was the launch party for Kowhitikaru, a zine focused on “Māori and Tauiwi of Colour's experiences in the art and music scenes in Aotearoa”, and as such featured some of the many excellent bands with connections to tangata whenua. Always great seeing Hōhā, CUCK, and E-Kare, and Half/Time who’d come from Hamilton really impressed too. Hope to see them back some time. Zine was also a good read.

### [E-KARE PRESENT DADA TECHNO](/gigs/e-kare-presents-dada-techno/)

<Image size="blog" responsiveImage={frontmatter.responsiveImages['dada']} alt="E-KARE PRESENT DADA TECHNO"/>

Dada techno resulted from an open call for players, which meant the lineup was particularly interesting, with a number of first time performers (including myself who played my first show as Euthanasia Rack). The kaupapa was explicitly low-pressure and positive, which I think encouraged unfettered creativity. It was also one of the best uses of YOURS I’ve seen, which can sometimes be a bit weird due to the high stage and hard surfaces, but by dividing the stage with sheets changeover times could be eliminated, and they could project PS2 games on the half which wasn’t being used. Shoutout E-Kare for being awesome.

### [Moider Mother and Human Susan's last gig](/gigs/moider-mother-human-susans-last-gig/)

<Image size="blog" responsiveImage={frontmatter.responsiveImages['human']} alt="Moider Mother and Human Susan's last gig"/>

One of those classic late in the year gigs where attendance is a bit low but good stuff happens, like one of the best examples of boomer entitlement I’ve ever witnessed: A man who wandered into the koha gig off the street expecting to see “live music” as he understood it (a guitar band playing mid tempo four chord dad rock probably) and instead got “live music” as it should be (a band called Adrenochrome Babies who opened their set with Trump’s acceptance speech blasted through an amp before frantically pacing around the venue stuttering stream of conscious epithets about the state of the world). After heckling the guitarist to “play a chord” (because how can you play music if you can’t play a chord!) the boomer walked out in a huff. Hilarious. 

The recording of the whole situation if you want to relive it:

Not to overshadow the fact that this was also Human Susan's last gig though, and they put on an excellent performance as usual, complete with the iconic crowd surfing geometry. Pour one out.

### [Eyegum Scenic Tours 4](/gigs/eyegum-scenic-tours-4/)

<Image size="blog" responsiveImage={frontmatter.responsiveImages['eyegum']} alt="Eyegum Scenic Tours 4"/>

I went to this for Bad Taste but ended up being really impressed by Ripship too (a few weeks later they opened for Jack White, so clearly someone else was impressed too). Very cool vocoder usage. And really good to see hip hop at the crown, it doesn't happen often.

## Operational changes

**New recording device:** My trusty Roland R-05 was less trusty this year (it would periodically turn off mid recording) so I upgraded to a Zoom H1 Essential whose big selling point is 32-bit float recording, meaning you can’t clip the file and don’t have to worry about gain. So far it’s been really great actually but does mean my files are bigger unless I transcode on ingest and throw away data.

**New website:** I rewrote the website this year, which you can [read about here](/blog/how_i_rewrote_my_huge_gatsby_site_in_astro_and_learned_to_love_it_in_the_process/). Still very happy with my decision to use Astro and it’s still ludicrously fast to build and deploy.

**New NAS:** Concerned that I only had one copy of the original media, and that it would cost a lot to back it up in the cloud, I built a Network Attached Storage. Stupidly though in the interest of cost I built it too small, so I’ve already filled up 4x4TB in RAID6 (ie. 8TB of space with dual parity). Not sure what I’ll do now, reliable SSDs are becoming so cheap, maybe redundant spinning disk arrays are no longer necessary…

**Dual camera:** For Dankfest I tried a new thing where I brought a second camera and gave it to anyone who wanted to film with it. This meant I could cut together highly dynamic videos, and also meant I was able to record entire sets with no breaks, but it was a lot of work so I’ll keep doing this only for a handful of gigs.

## State of venues

This year the venue situation remained roughly the same. [Pearl Diver](/venues/pearl_diver/) continues to cement itself as an important addition, [Erricks](/venues/erricks) continues to serve $13 pints (which are actually 330ml half pints) in plastic cups, the development around the Crown Hotel continues to be an ever increasing threat, and the council continues to at least *appear* to care about the situation.

Save Dunedin Live Music worked with the council this year to develop a [Live Music Action Plan](https://www.dunedin.govt.nz/services/arts-and-culture/otepoti-live-music-action-plan), which has a lot of good stuff in it and is definitely a step forward, but it remains to be seen how serious the council actually are about doing anything. There’s also a group of volunteers from various parts of the scene working to advise them, which also sounds like a great thing, but we shouldn’t count our chickens just yet.

One tangible change: Noise insulation requirements for new builds in the city have been increased from 35db to 40db. Unfortunately it comes too late for the development next to the Crown Hotel which was already consented under the old rules.
