title: Erricks
description: Located in an historic brick building once used for horse related activities,
  Erricks arose from the corpse of <a href="/venues/new_new_new">New New New</a> and immediately started serving 
  330ml "pints" in branded plastic cups. It went on to become the PREMIUM destination
  for yuppies of Dunedin to have their wedding receptions, as well as hosting the odd gig here and there.
