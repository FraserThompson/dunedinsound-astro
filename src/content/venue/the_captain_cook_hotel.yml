description: An iconic student pub which closed in 2014 due to declining revenue. Prior to that it hosted many gigs in the 80s and 90s, and fewer gigs in the 00s. It was reopened briefly in 2016 after some property developers decided to renovate it into a trendy restaurant but their venture failed a year later (probably because a trendy restaurant in the heart of studentville makes no sense). Then in 2018 it was purchased by former <a href="/venues/chicks_hotel">Chicks Hotel</a> operator Mike McLoed and the top floor was reopened as a music focused venue. "The Captain Cook Hotel" died in 2020 when it was renamed, but the venue lived on as <a href="/venues/dive">Dive</a>.
