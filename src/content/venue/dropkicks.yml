description: After the unceremonious closure of <a href="/venues/dive">Dive</a>, the upstairs of the former 
  Captain Cook Hotel sat vacant until the Lobo dynasty decided to take the reigns. 
  Now it's Dropkicks, there's fake greenery and neon platitudes everywhere, the 
  sound desk is gone, and they don't have beer on tap. Much like the other Lobo 
  venture <a href="/venues/erricks">Erricks</a>, it feels like the focus is more 
  on events (21st parties, etc) than gigs, but beggars can't be choosers.
