## What is this?

The aim of dunedinsound.com is to document and archive a vertical slice of the music scene in Dunedin as it happens.

Most of that is done by going to gigs, documenting them via photo, video and audio, then archiving them here.

[The Dunedin Sound](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunedin_sound) is often described as a movement from the past. This site is a reminder that great music never stopped coming out of Dunedin.

## Are you making money?

dunedinsound.com is radically non-commercial: no sponsors, no ads, no money. The intent is to support the music community and not take anything from it.

The current cost of hosting everything is around **\$10** a month. I will continue paying this for as long as I can.

By the way, all works are licensed under a <a rel="license" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/">Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International License</a>.

Translation: You can do whatever you want as long as you mention dunedinsound.com and you're not making loads of money off of it (contact fraser@dunedinsound.com if you want to use it commercially).

I'm not affiliated with any venue or band so consider my audio recordings bootlegs.

## Why not just put stuff on Facebook or Instagram like everyone else?

Most social media networks are terrible for archiving.

- They're not indexed by Google or other search engines
- Finding anything is a chore because they're more interested in making money off you than providing a good service
- The image and video compression can be very aggressive and makes media look bad

"Anything you put online is there forever" is a common misconception - if you're posting content on someone elses platform there's no gaurantee it will be there tomorrow. Trusting a for-profit entity who primarily trades in attention with the important task of preserving history and culture is unwise.

dunedinsound.com is a permanent archive, artists/fans will be able to access it decades from now, and it should be pretty easy to find what they're after.

...having said that, all of my videos are hosted [on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@dunedinsound), which is a platform run by a profit-driven entity which cares not for people, and would happily abandon us the moment the profit incentive went away. I do this because hosting video is very expensive. I retain original copies of all videos though, so if the need arose I could self-host.

## What equipment do you use?

In case you're curious (I would be).

### Audio

Electret microphones modified to withstand higher volumes and shoved into a pair of earplugs. They go in my ears and record sound with the added benefit of protecting my hearing somewhat. This is how I get decent recordings without setting anything up. They go to a battery box which goes to a Zoom H1 Essential portable recorder. (Shoutout Roland R-05 which went strong for ten years until it broke)

My recording rig is wearable, so I can just stand in the audience and get a pretty good recording. Also, unlike a recording from the soundboard my recordings capture exactly what it sounded like from the audience, which can be really good or really bad or anywhere in between.

Most of the recordings are [binaural](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binaural_recording) so that means they'll sound best on headphones.

You can read more about this setup [here](/blog/so_you_want_to_bootleg_live_music_with_a_wearable_and_discreet_recording_rig_which_also_doubles_as_hearing_protection_and_doesnt_cost_that_much/). 

### Photos and Video

Panasonic S5 camera with an assortment of (semi) pocketable lenses, often vintage M42 mount lenses (Asahi Pentax 50mm 1.4 is my favourite). I wrote a blog post about this camera [here](/blog/micro_four_thirds_vs_full_frame_bigger_more_expensive_but_is_it_better). Also a big fan of cheap manual focus Chinese lenses from the likes of 7Artisans and Pangear (I'm not gonna pay like $1k+ for a lens, that's insane).

Warning: All telephoto images were taken on the USSR produced Jupiter-11A 135mm which means they are <strong style={{color: 'red'}}>communist images</strong>.

Panasonic G85 as a b-cam for multi-angle video.

### Workflow

* Photo: 24MP RAW files > DXO PhotoLab (denoising, contra st, and colour adjustment) > JPG > WebP responsive proxies and MozJPEG compressed original
* Video: 4K H264 files (LOG) > Magix Vegas (colour grading, trimming) > 4K H265 for YouTube
* Audio: 96khz 32-bit float WAV > Magix Vegas (limiting, compression, EQ) > 44.1khz 16-bit MP3 VBR V0

None of the media on dunedinsound.com has been modified via AI.

## Can I contribute images/videos I've taken?

In theory, yes. Check the [contribution guidelines](/page/contribution_guidelines/).

## Can I support you financially?

Sure. If you want to help support this kaupapa you can [make a one-time or recurring donation at Ko-Fi](https://ko-fi.com/dunedinsound) (it's like Patreon but better).

## I've got something to say!

Want full resolution JPGs? Help yourself, there's download button at the top right after opening an image. Maybe you want copies of videos though? Or want me to come to your gig? Or something else? You can contact me here: <a href="mailto:fraser@dunedinsound.com">fraser@dunedinsound.com</a>

Also if you want content featuring you removed from the website for any reason feel free to contact me. I am not here to make anyone uncomfortable and that's more important than any overarching purpose.

This website is not for self-promotion so don't ask me to add your band, that's not how it works.
