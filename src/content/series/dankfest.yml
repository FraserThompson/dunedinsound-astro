title: Dankfest
description: Organized by Dance Happy Doom Crew (<a href="/artists/cuck">CUCK</a>), Dankfest is an annual multi-day event at the Crown Hotel focusing on heavy/extreme music from ÅŒtepoti and the wider motu. It functions as a sort of unofficial crown-fest, it being the only night of the year when the pool table is relocated in order to make more room, which is just as well because it gets pretty packed. Recently they've added a daytime all-ages variant to the weekend which takes place at YOURS.
