title: Feastock
description: Held annually in a backyard on Fea Street since 2009, Feastock is as much a gathering of mates as it is a music festival. Sure the music is always a varied mix of the best local and less local talent, but it's more about the vibes, spending a day with good people in the sunshine (or rain as is often the case in April when it's held).
